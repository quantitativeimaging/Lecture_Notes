## Corrosion Course
PDF notes for my undergraduate Corrosion lecture course for chemical engineers.
* Corrosion Notes Handout 1: lecture notes mainly on the algebra of corrosion (thermodynamics and kinetics) and introductory material.
* Corrosion Notes Handout 2: lecture notes describing corrosion phenomena and corrosion protection, often making use of the algebra from handout 1.
* Example Sheet 1: algebra of electrochemical corrosion
* Example Sheet 1 solutions: worked solutions to the first question sheet.
